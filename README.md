# game-project

This project is to make a fully functioning browser based game using HTML, CSS/SCSS and JavaScript.


## Requirements ##

• You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub

      o In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
  
• You must have at least 15 Git commits for the project and repo on GitHub

• Your JS code must be formatted as functions or Classes!

• You must use click or keypress events in JavaScript to trigger the events in the game.
  (No refreshing to start the game again!!)
  
• Beware of following a “How to make a game in JS tutorial”. Watching a video is not the
  same as learning to code. Some of the stuff you’ll have to do we won’t have covered so
  If you can’t explain it or don’t understand it, you can’t use it.
  
• We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to
  work on different device widths.
  
• USE THE COACHES: It’s extremely normal to need help and guidance here, approaching
  your first properly open ended task with no guidelines on what functions and tools are
  needed. The coaches have done this a lot, make sure you use them!!!!!
  
• Add a link to this project on your portfolio – this is your first chance to really show off
  your web skills!
